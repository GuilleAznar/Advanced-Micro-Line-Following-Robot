# Advanced-Micro-Line-Following-Robot
Line following algorithm for the MSP-432 LaunchPad and the RSLK add on.

This lab is counts as the final project for the class. It is very similar in objective to lab 8. We will be using any sensor method available to us on the RSLK robot to have it navigate through a track on the floor of the lab. We intend to learn more about navigation algorithms, sensors, and obstacle avoidance in this lab. Despite there being several sensor methodologies available on the RSLK, the one that is more readily available for us in the lab are the IRLEDs, so this is the one that we used along with most of the class. The IRLEDs will detect the black line at the center of the track and use an algorithm that we developed to navigate through the track.
